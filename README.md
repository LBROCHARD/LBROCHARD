### Hi ! 👋

My name is Louis Brochard 😄,

I'm a french student in computer sciences at YNOV (2nd Year 👨‍💻) in the city of Nantes !

I really like music 🎵 : listening to it, playing it, and composing some ! (🎸🎹)

I also like video game 🎮 (like everybody I guess...), and I'm curently working on one with my friends  !

I did a lot of projects for school 📚 and for myself, helped with some fantastic peoples. 
And all of them can be found on my profile page !
