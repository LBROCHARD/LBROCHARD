### Hi ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Louis, a french student in computer sciences at YNOV Nantes (Master 1)

I'm currently working half time at Sogeti (part of Capgemini) for a Metavers project using Unity.

I'm into everything that's in between code and 3D, I already know how to use Unity, C#, Blender, Godot and many more !
I'm actually learning C++ and OpenGL, as well as Unreal Engine.
I also know how to use Web frameworks such as React and Vue, and I did a lot of JS during my formation.

I did a lot of projects for school and for myself, and many of them can be found on my profile page, so if you're interested, go check them out !

Here is my [resume](https://github.com/LBROCHARD/LBROCHARD/blob/main/resume.md) (in french, and a bit outdated) if you are interested.
