### Hi ! 👋

I'm Louis, a french student in computer sciences at YNOV (3nd Year 👨‍💻) in the city of Nantes !

I really like music : listening to it, playing it, and composing some !

I did a lot of projects for school and for myself, And all of them can be found on my profile page !

Here is my [resume](https://github.com/LBROCHARD/LBROCHARD/blob/main/resume.md) (in french) if you are interested.
